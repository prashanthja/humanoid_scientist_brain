Our method leverages a multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model to ensure realistic and physically consistent outpainting results. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LightsOut consistently boosts the performance of existing SIFR methods across challenging scenarios without additional retraining, serving as a universally applicable plug-and-play preprocessing solution.

The framework combines three-dimensional gravitational wave skymaps with host-galaxy information, a morphology-aware host association, empirical offset priors, and peculiar velocity corrections. We apply the method to GW170817 where it ranks AT2017gfo as the top candidate and correctly selects NGC\\,4993 as the host.

We construct an action principle for scalar fields in phase space and derive the corresponding scalar field equation.

The global maximum of the metric is at the $\\Gamma$ point, but other differential geometric properties like Ricci scalar, Ricci tensor, and Einstein tensor are found to vary significantly in the momentum space, indicating a highly distorted momentum space manifold. The momentum integration of the quantum metric further yields the gauge-invariant part of the spread of valence band Wannier function, whose value agrees well with that experimentally extracted from an optical sum rule of the dielectric function. Furthermore, the dependence of these geometric properties on the energy gap offers a way to quantify the quantum criticality of these common semiconductors."

Building on this growing trajectory, this article introduces a new paradigm for Neuro-Microgrids, inspired by the brain's sensorimotor gating mechanisms, specifically the Prepulse Inhibition (PPI) and Prepulse Facilitation (PPF). Sensorimotor gating offers a biological model for selectively suppressing or amplifying responses depending on contextual relevance. By mapping these principles onto the hierarchical control architecture of microgrids, we propose a Sensorimotor Gating-Inspired Neuro-Microgrid (SG-NMG) framework.

In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage (FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity, outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit depth or gate count.

Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study with a pre-test, post-test and a control group design. The research population included all Iranian pregnant women referring to Laleh Hospital in Tehran City, Iran, in 2020. In total, 30 women were selected using the convenience sampling method and randomly assigned into the intervention and control groups (n=15/group). The required data were collected using the Life Distress Inventory (LDI) and the Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale (MFAS). The intervention group listened to relaxing music for twelve 45-50-minute sessions in the morning and during routine midwifery visits; however, the controls received no intervention. The collected data were analyzed using "

    "text": "Background: Emotional divorce refers to a situation in which the emotional relationship, support, passion, warmth, attention, love, and intimacy between couples (husband &amp; wife) decline or diminish. Such conditions lead to an unaffectionate marital life to the point that the couples are only together under one roof. Accordingly, the present study aimed to explore the role of attachment styles and spiritual intelligence in predicting emotional divorce in women. Methods: This study employed a descriptive-correlational design. The research population included all women filing for divorce who were referred to marriage counseling and couple therapy centers in districts 5 and 6 in Tehran City, Iran, in 2020. In total, 400 women who met the inclusion criteria were selected as the study participants using voluntary response and convenience sampling techniques. The required data were collected by the Emotional Divorce Scale, the Adult Attachment Scale, and the Self-Report Measure of Spiritu"

    "text": "Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption, which collapses \\emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and computational challenges of learning a \\emph{correlated} probit model, a fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is \\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information, explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this setting. Next, we demonst"

Our method leverages a multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model to ensure realistic and physically consistent outpainting results. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LightsOut consistently boosts the performance of existing SIFR methods across challenging scenarios without additional retraining, serving as a universally applicable plug-and-play preprocessing solution.

The resulting \"boundary-informed MOL-PINN\" matches or surpasses conventional MOL in accuracy using an order of magnitude fewer collocation points, thereby shrinking memory footprints, lessening dependence on large data sets, and increasing complexity robustness.

We present a Bayesian ranking method to identify electromagnetic counterparts to GW events using only location information. The framework combines three-dimensional gravitational wave skymaps with host-galaxy information, a morphology-aware host association, empirical offset priors, and peculiar velocity corrections. We apply the method to GW170817 where it ranks AT2017gfo as the top candidate and correctly selects NGC\\,4993 as the host. The approach is directly applicable to transient candidates with only location information and enables more efficient follow-up with prioritized candidates and leads to more reliable counterpart identification in current and future observing runs."

However, amplifier non-linearity often prevents a simple linear fit of this characteristic, introducing errors that can compromise stability. To address this, we present a modified calibration procedure that incorporates amplifier non-linearity into the SEL framework.

The fundamental field, which contains information about all physical fields in spacetime and defines the phase space geometry, is a scalar field in phase space that is interpreted as a point-particle Hamiltonian. We construct an action principle for scalar fields in phase space and derive the corresponding scalar field equation. By choosing a specific scalar field, namely the Hamiltonian describing a charged particle in curved spacetime with an electromagnetic field, we show that this phase-space scalar field equation is equivalent to the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations in spacetime, thus providing a"

Other method may be very good, but it is not perfect. Some part is very nice, another part is problematic. General Theory of Relativity holds that gravity is geometric. Quantum Mechanics describes all particles by wave function of trigonometry.

    "text": "A charged particle, moving at a constant velocity, carries along its electrostatic field Eo . But, as a result of finite speed of light, a particle of charge Q and mass m moving at time t with velocity v and acceleration dv/dt, has a resultant of its electrostatic field in the opposite direction of accelerarion. So, a reactive electric field Ea proportional to and in the opposite direction of the acceleration is created. The field Ea acts only on the same charge Q, producing it, to generate an inertial force f= QEa = -m (dv/dt), where m is a constant equal to the rest mass. For a neutral body of mass M, composed of N/2 positive and N/2 negative charges, the inertial forces on the charges add up to Nf =NQEa = -Nm (dv/dt) = -M (dv/dt). This explains the cause of inertia, the tendency of a body to resist acceleration or deceleration, as the result of self-induced reactive forces on the electric charges composing the body, contrary to general relativity.

Sensorimotor gating offers a biological model for selectively suppressing or amplifying responses depending on contextual relevance. By mapping these principles onto the hierarchical control architecture of microgrids, we propose a Sensorimotor Gating-Inspired Neuro-Microgrid (SG-NMG) framework.

Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity, outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit depth or gate count.

For invariant networks, we establish a universality theorem under separation constraints, showing that the addition of a fully connected readout layer secures approximation within the class of separation-constrained continuous functions.

A central and challenging problem in combinatorial commutative algebra is to classify all clutters $\\mathcal H$ for which $I(\\mathcal H)^{(k)} = I(\\mathcal H)^{k}$ for a fixed positive integer $k$, where $I(\\mathcal H)^{(k)}$ denotes the $k^{th}$ symbolic power of $I(\\mathcal H)$. In this article, we provide a complete solution to this problem for $(n-2)$-uniform clutters. Also, we give a simple combinatorial classification of all $(n-2)$-uniform clutters having the packing property. As a consequence, we confirm the celebrated Conforti-Cornu\\'ejols conjecture for $(n-2)$-uniform clutters, which asserts that a clutter $\\mathcal H$ satisfies the max-flow min-cut (MFMC) property if and only if it satisfies the packing property."

    "text": "Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now powering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external environments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal (what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed). Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of proposed tasks and"

    "text": "Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability. PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This highli"

    "text": "Chance-constrained programming is a widely used framework for decision-making under uncertainty, yet its mixed-integer reformulations involve nonconvex mixing sets with a knapsack constraint, leading to weak relaxations and computational challenges. Most existing approaches for strengthening the relaxations of these sets rely primarily on extensions of a specific class of valid inequalities, limiting both convex hull coverage and the discovery of fundamentally new structures. In this paper, we develop a novel convexification framework that reformulates chance-constrained sets as bilinear sets over a simplex in a lifted space and employs a step-by-step aggregation procedure to derive facet-defining inequalities in the original space of variables. Our approach generalizes and unifies established families of valid inequalities in the literature while introducing new ones that capture substantially larger portions of the convex hull. Main contributions include: (i) the development of a new"

    "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT, an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend on external medical know"

In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model, we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of model performance.

However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption, which collapses \\emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and computational challenges of learning a \\emph{correlated} probit model, a fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is \\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information, explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this setting.

    "text": "Lens flare significantly degrades image quality, impacting critical computer vision tasks like object detection and autonomous driving. Recent Single Image Flare Removal (SIFR) methods perform poorly when off-frame light sources are incomplete or absent. We propose LightsOut, a diffusion-based outpainting framework tailored to enhance SIFR by reconstructing off-frame light sources. Our method leverages a multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model to ensure realistic and physically consistent outpainting results. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LightsOut consistently boosts the performance of existing SIFR methods across challenging scenarios without additional retraining, serving as a universally applicable plug-and-play preprocessing solution.

Instead of approximating spatial derivatives with fixed finite-difference stencils - whose truncation errors force extremely fine meshes - our method trains a neural network to represent the initial spatial profile and then employs automatic differentiation to obtain spectrally accurate gradients at arbitrary nodes. These high-fidelity derivatives define the right-hand side of the MOL-generated ordinary-differential system, and time integration is replaced with a secondary temporal PINN while spatial accuracy is retained without mesh refinement. The resulting \"boundary-informed MOL-PINN\" matches or surpasses conventional MOL in accuracy using an order of magnitude fewer collocation points, thereby shrinking memory footprints, lessening dependence on large data sets, and increasing complexity robustness.

This region overlaps with a recently reported dark photon signal at 19.5 $\\mu$eV with a kinetic coupling strength of $|\\chi_{\\text{rand}}| \\simeq 6.5 \\times 10^{-15}$ resulting from a reanalysis of previously published data from the TASEH collaboration. Given HAYSTAC's sensitivity, if such a signal were present, it would have appeared as a large $17.1\\sigma$ excess above the noise. However, no such signal was observed. We thus exclude couplings $|\\chi_{\\text{rand}}|\\geq 4.90\\times10^{-15}$ at the 90\\% confidence level over the newly reported region. In addition, using our previously reported axion data, we exclude couplings $|\\chi_{\\text{rand}}|\\geq2.90\\times 10^{-15}$ between 16.96--19.46 $\\mu$eV at the 90\\% confidence level."

The traditional graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry, material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets.

We tabulate all relevant thresholds and compute the di-hadron content of each predicted state. Our results produce no particular hidden-strange tetraquark candidate whose structure is dominated by di-hadron structure, in contrast to the charm sector, where many exotic states are strongly associated with such thresholds. Multiple states above 2~GeV with peculiar decay properties, including $\\phi(2170)$, $f_2(2340)$, and $\\eta(2370)$, continue to serve as excellent hidden-strange tetraquark candidates."

We present a Bayesian ranking method to identify electromagnetic counterparts to GW events using only location information. The framework combines three-dimensional gravitational wave skymaps with host-galaxy information, a morphology-aware host association, empirical offset priors, and peculiar velocity corrections. We apply the method to GW170817 where it ranks AT2017gfo as the top candidate and correctly selects NGC\\,4993 as the host. The approach is directly applicable to transient candidates with only location information and enables more efficient follow-up with prioritized candidates and leads to more reliable counterpart identification in current and future observing runs."

For equivariant networks, where results are even scarcer, we demonstrate that standard separability notions are inadequate and introduce the sharper criterion of $\\textit{entry-wise separability}$. We show that with sufficient depth or with the addition of appropriate readout layers, equivariant networks attain universality within the entry-wise separable regime. Together with "

We propose \\textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring real-time, immersive 3D exploration.

To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis.

We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal (what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed). Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%.

Most existing approaches for strengthening the relaxations of these sets rely primarily on extensions of a specific class of valid inequalities, limiting both convex hull coverage and the discovery of fundamentally new structures. In this paper, we develop a novel convexification framework that reformulates chance-constrained sets as bilinear sets over a simplex in a lifted space and employs a step-by-step aggregation procedure to derive facet-defining inequalities in the original space of variables. Our approach generalizes and unifies established families of valid inequalities in the literature while introducing new ones that capture substantially larger portions of the convex hull.

To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT, an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed for high-stakes medical dialogue.

The framework combines three-dimensional gravitational wave skymaps with host-galaxy information, a morphology-aware host association, empirical offset priors, and peculiar velocity corrections. We apply the method to GW170817 where it ranks AT2017gfo as the top candidate and correctly selects NGC\\,4993 as the host.

However, amplifier non-linearity often prevents a simple linear fit of this characteristic, introducing errors that can compromise stability. To address this, we present a modified calibration procedure that incorporates amplifier non-linearity into the SEL framework.

We construct an action principle for scalar fields in phase space and derive the corresponding scalar field equation.

We explain how field theory gives a precise way to understand these constructions, and how computability theory shows that no finite geometric method can produce every computable number. In particular, no construction process that can be described step by step can reach uncomputable numbers.

This study aimed to investigate the performance of enhanced modified Ludzack Ettinger process-oxic settling anaerobic (MLE-OSA) process for treating real municipal wastewater in Sari wastewater Treatment, Sari City, Iran. Methods: To combine the OSA process technique with the MLE system, the Sludge Holding Tanks (SHT) were implemented in the return sludge line of designed pilot studies which comprised 1) MLE, which was regarded as the control system similar; 2) MLE-OSA4 with a 70-L SHT operated at 4-h Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), and 3) MLEOSA6 with a 107-L SHT operated at 6-h HRT. To start the process, the overflow effluent of the primary settling tank of the Sari wastewater treatment plant was used. After 45-60 days, the reactors reached a steady state.

    "text": "Background: Today, soil pollution with heavy metals and petroleum compounds is one of the main environmental problems. This research was done to investigate the effect of drought stress, soil salinity, Piriformospora indica (P. indica), and MWCNs on biodegradation of diesel oil in the soil that contaminated with Pb and Cd under cultivation of triticale plant. Methods: Treatments consisted of applying MWCNs (2% [W/W]) in the Pb- and Cd-polluted soil that was simultaneously polluted with diesel oil (0, 5, and 10% [W/W]), and the plants used in this study were inoculated with P. indica. After 70 days, plants were harvested, and plant and soil Cd were measured using AAS (atomic absorption spectrometry). In addition, the degradation percentage of diesel oil in soil was determined. Results: Soil application of MWCNs at the rate of 2% (W/W) significantly increased the biodegradation of diesel oil in the soil in the drought and salinity (6 dS/m) stress by 11.3% and 15.6%, respectively.

The present study aimed to assess the effects of relaxing music on life distress and Maternal-Fetal Attachment (MFA) in pregnant women. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study with a pre-test, post-test and a control group design. The research population included all Iranian pregnant women referring to Laleh Hospital in Tehran City, Iran, in 2020. In total, 30 women were selected using the convenience sampling method and randomly assigned into the intervention and control groups (n=15/group). The required data were collected using the Life Distress Inventory (LDI) and the Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale (MFAS). The intervention group listened to relaxing music for twelve 45-50-minute sessions in the morning and during routine midwifery visits; however, the controls received no intervention. The collected data were analyzed using "

Such conditions lead to an unaffectionate marital life to the point that the couples are only together under one roof. Accordingly, the present study aimed to explore the role of attachment styles and spiritual intelligence in predicting emotional divorce in women. Methods: This study employed a descriptive-correlational design. The research population included all women filing for divorce who were referred to marriage counseling and couple therapy centers in districts 5 and 6 in Tehran City, Iran, in 2020. In total, 400 women who met the inclusion criteria were selected as the study participants using voluntary response and convenience sampling techniques.

    "text": "Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption, which collapses \\emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and computational challenges of learning a \\emph{correlated} probit model, a fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is \\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information, explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this setting. Next, we demonst"

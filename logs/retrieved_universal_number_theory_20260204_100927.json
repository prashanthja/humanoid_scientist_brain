    "text": "<p>‘What is number theory?’ puts number theory in its historical context, from the Pythagoreans to the present, explaining integers (whole numbers), prime numbers (the building blocks of number theory) squares and cubes, and perfect numbers (numbers whose factors add up to the number itself). How long can gaps between prime numbers be? Is there a formula for producing perfect numbers? Which primes can be expressed as a sum of squares? Other questions arise when we start adding primes.</p>",

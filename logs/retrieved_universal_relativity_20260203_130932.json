    "text": "<p>This chapter describes the program, dubbed ‘Relativity without Relativity’, of deriving all the fundamental accepted facts at the basis of modern field theory from relational principles. A best-matching action based on Jacobi’s principle is in fact sufficient to derive the universality of the light cone (Special Relativity), the correct form of Maxwell’s action and its gauge invariance, as well as the Yang–Mills theory. Faraday is credited with the introduction of the concept of field in physics. He found it extremely useful, in particular for the description of magnetic phenomena, to use the concept of lines of force (1830s).</p>",

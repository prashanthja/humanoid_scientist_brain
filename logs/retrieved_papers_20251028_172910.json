    "text": "The emergence of order in many-body systems and the associated self-similar dynamics governed by dynamical scaling laws is a hallmark of universality far from equilibrium. Measuring and classifying such nontrivial behavior for novel symmetry classes remains challenging. Here, we realize a well-controlled interlayer coupling quench in a tunable bilayer two-dimensional Bose gas, driving the system to an ordered phase. We observe robust self-similar dynamics and a universal critical exponent consistent with diffusion-like coarsening, driven by vortex and antivortex annihilation induced by the interlayer coupling. Our results extend the understanding of universal dynamics in many-body systems and provide a robust foundation for quantitative tests of nonequilibrium effective field theories.",

    "title": "The Compressed 3D Lyman-Alpha Forest Bispectrum",
    "text": "Cosmological studies of the Lyman-Alpha (Lya) forest typically constrain parameters using two-point statistics. However, higher-order statistics, such as the three-point function (or its Fourier counterpart, the bispectrum) offer additional information and help break the degeneracy between the mean flux and power spectrum amplitude, albeit at a significant computational cost. To address this, we extend an existing highly informative compression of the bispectrum, the skew spectra, to the Lya forest. We derive the tree-level bispectrum of Lya forest fluctuations in the framework of effective field theory (EFT) directly in redshift space and validate our methodology on synthetic Lya forest data. We measure the anisotropic cross-spectra between the transmitted flux fraction and all quadratic operators arising in the bispectrum, yielding a set of 26 skew spectra. Using idealized 3D Gaussian smoothing (R=10 Mpc/h), we find good agreement (1-2 sigma level based on the statistical errors of the mocks) with the theoretical tree-level bispectrum prediction for monopole and quadrupole up to k &lt;= 0.17 h/Mpc. To enable the cosmological analysis of Lya forest data from the currently observing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), where we cannot do 3D smoothing, we use a line-of-sight smoothing and introduce a new statistic, the shifted skew spectra. These probe non-squeezed bispectrum triangles and avoid locally applying quadratic operators to the field by displacing one copy of the field in the radial direction. Using a fixed displacement of 40 Mpc/h (and line-of-sight smoothing of 10 Mpc/h) yields a similar agreement with the theory prediction. For the special case of correlating the squared (and displaced) field with the original one, we analytically forward model the window function making this approach readily applicable to DESI data.",

    "text": "A limitation of analog quantum simulators based on cold atoms in optical lattices is that readout is typically limited to observables diagonal in the charge basis, i.e., densities and density correlation functions. To overcome this limitation, we propose experiment-friendly schemes to measure charge-off-diagonal correlations (such as currents). Our protocols use non-interacting dynamics for random times followed by standard quantum gas microscope measurements to effectively measure in random bases. The main requirement of our scheme is the ability to turn off interactions, which can be done in many atomic species using Feshbach resonances. Importantly, our scheme requires no local control and otherwise also exhibits modest requirements in terms of total evolution time and number of repetitions. We numerically demonstrate efficient estimation of bilinear correlation functions, requiring less than $4000$ samples to measure local currents to 5% error (system-size independent) and $\\sim 10^4$ samples to simultaneously measure all non-local correlations in 70-site systems. Due to its simplicity, our protocol is implementable in existing platforms and thus paves the way to precision measurements beyond particle number measurements.",

We study the quantum chaos and pole-skipping phenomenon in the strongly coupled charged rotating fluids, holographically dual to rotating black holes with nontrivial gauge field. We find that the near-horizon equation governing energy-density fluctuations differs from the source-less shock wave equation determining the OTOC, which depends on the $U(1)$ gauge choice. This discrepancy is eliminated under an appropriate boundary condition on the $U(1)$ gauge potential at the event horizon, as required by the vanishing of Wilson loop at the Euclidean horizon.

    "text": "Fiber optic pulsed polarimetry is a LIDAR-like fiber sensing technique that uses a backscatter enhanced single mode backscatter-tailored optical fiber(BTOF) to measure the distributed B fields on all Magnetic Fusion Energy devices. The BTOF has a series of wavelength resonant reflection fiber Bragg gratings written uniformly along its length. The fiber's Verdet constant determines the strength of the Faraday effect which effectuates the measurement of local B along the fiber placed intimately next to or within a magnetized plasma volume. A robust measurement of the field distribution along the fiber is obtained at high rep rates, 5 MHz, high spatial resolution(1-10cm), high B field accuracy(&lt;1%) and temporal response (ns). Multipathing in the BTOF produces 3rd order reflections that contaminate the LIDAR signal. Algorithms are given for calculating the level of contamination for uniform and flat reflection designs, in particular and any reflection series in general. The contamination is bracketed giving confidence in designing and implementing a BTOF. Applications include magnetic fusion devices, rail guns, high temperature superconducting magnets and magnetized target fusion research.",

    "text": "The use of magnetic nanographenes as building blocks for artificial spin lattices is enabling the exploration of flagship model Hamiltonians of one-dimensional quantum magnetism with an unprecedented degree of control. The spin-1 Heisenberg model, incorporating both linear and quadratic exchange interactions, was first realized using [3]-triangulenes, where the hallmark Haldane phase with spin fractionalization was observed. Later, the spin-1/2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian with exchange alternation was realized with Clar's goblets, where two additional topological phases were identified. Here we show that spin-1 nanographenes can also be used to explore the topological phase transition between the Haldane phase and a dimerized phase predicted for spin-1 chains with bond-alternation. We first study how the boundary of the phase transition is modified by non-linear exchange, known to be present in spin-1 nanographenes, using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Combining multiconfigurational with first-principles calculations, we propose two candidates to realize different topological phases of the model: a recently synthesized extended Clar's goblet, and a passivated [4]-triangulene. Moreover, we show how these two phases can be identified experimentally using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). This work paves the way for the experimental realization of these topological phases, which can be locally probed with scanning tunneling microscopy.",

    "text": "The intermittent nature of renewable power availability is one of the major sources of uncertainty in power systems. While markets can guarantee that the demand is covered by the available generation, transmission system operators have to often intervene via economic redispatch to ensure that the physical constraints of the network are satisfied. To account for uncertainty, the underlying optimal power flow (OPF) routines have to be modified. Recently, polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) has been suggested in the literature as a tool for stochastic OPF problems. However, the usage of PCE-based methods in security-constrained OPF for (N-1)-secure operations has not yet been explored. In this paper, we propose a procedure that iteratively solves a PCE-overloaded stochastic OPF problem by including line outage constraints until an (N-1)-secure solution is achieved. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by comparing it with a Monte-Carlo simulation on a 118-bus example system.",

In this work, we introduce a variational framework that leverages matrix product states for the efficient classical evaluation of the Helmholtz free energy, combining scalable entanglement entropy computation with a hardware efficient ansatz to accurately approximate thermal states in one- and two-dimensional systems. We conduct extensive benchmarking on key observables, including energy density, susceptibility, specific heat, and two-point correlations, comparing against exact analytical results for 1D systems and quantum Monte Carlo simulations for 2D lattices across various temperatures and ansatz configurations. Our large-scale numerical simulations demonstrate the capability to prepare high-quality Gibbs states for 1D lattice models with up to 30 sites and 2D systems with up to 6x6 sites, using up to 42 qubits. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's practical viability on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor by preparing the approximate Gibbs state of a 30-site transverse-field Ising model. Leveraging a combination of error mitigation techniques, we reduce the relative errors in energy and susceptibility measurements by over 50% compared to unmitigated results.",

Their non-volatile nature and ability to mimic synaptic behavior make them ideal for next-generation memory technologies and neuromorphic computing systems inspired by the human brain. In this study, we present a novel organic spintronic memristor based on a La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/Co heterostructure, exhibiting biologically inspired synaptic behavior. Driven by fluorine atom migration within the PVDF layer, the device demonstrates both long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) under controlled electrical polarization. Distinctively, the resistance states can also be modulated by an external magnetic field via the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, introducing a non-electrical means of tuning synaptic plasticity. This magnetic control mechanism enables multi-state modulation without compromising device performance or endurance. Furthermore, convolutional neural network (CNN) simulations incorporating this magnetic tuning capability reveal enhanced pattern recognition accuracy and improved training stability, especially at high learning rates. These findings underscore the potential of organic spintronic memristors as high-performance, low-power neuromorphic elements, particularly suited for applications in flexible and wearable electronics.",

Even when the which-path information is merely retained in specific quantum path-markers, without being actually read, it suffices to eliminate interference. Nevertheless, if this path information is ``erased'' in some manner, the interference re-emerges, a phenomenon referred to as the quantum eraser. An intriguing aspect of this experiment is that if the path information is erased \\emph{after} the particle has been detected on the screen, the interference still reappears, a phenomenon known as the delayed-choice quantum eraser. This observation has led to the interpretation that the particle can be influenced to exhibit characteristics of either a particle or a wave based on a decision made long after it has been registered on the screen. This idea has sparked considerable debate and discussions surrounding retrocausality. This controversy is reviewed here, and a detailed resolution provided.",

    "text": "Trapped ion (TI) qubits are a leading quantum computing platform. Current TI systems have less than 60 qubits, but a modular architecture known as the Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) is a promising path to scale up devices. There is a large gap between the error rates of near-term systems ($10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$) and the requirements of practical applications (below $10^{-9}$). To bridge this gap, we require Quantum Error Correction (QEC) to build \\emph{logical qubits} that are composed of multiple physical qubits. While logical qubits have been demonstrated on TI qubits, these demonstrations are restricted to small codes and systems. There is no clarity on how QCCD systems should be designed to implement practical-scale QEC. This paper studies how surface codes, a standard QEC scheme, can be implemented efficiently on QCCD-based systems. To examine how architectural parameters of a QCCD system can be tuned for surface codes, we develop a near-optimal topology-aware compilation method that outperforms existing QCCD compilers by an average of 3.8X in terms of logical clock speed. We use this compiler to examine how hardware trap capacity, connectivity and electrode wiring choices can be optimised for surface code implementation. In particular, we demonstrate that small traps of two ions are surprisingly ideal from both a performance-optimal and hardware-efficiency standpoint. This result runs counter to prior intuition that larger traps (20-30 ions) would be preferable, and has the potential to inform design choices for upcoming systems.",

All dimensions present (at least 5) exist together within the matrix of the universe and in any regional matrix; subgroups of these dimensions are present. • Space has no dimension, precharge exists in a single dimension, prephotons exist in two; neutrons (complete matter) in 3 and blackholes in 4. • The definitions of time and space mean that exchanges of information state (ct state) between space and prephotonsoccur independent of time. Time as we experience arises between the prephoton states and ends with compression to neutrons. 2. All change is quantum change in response to a single variable leading to the universe existing as a series of quantum states or snapshots. Force and time are effects based on this quantum change. 3. Time and change are different. Changes in the single variable lead to time, but time is not required for that underlying change nor does it affect that change. 4. Time is an effect like force and dimension of the quantum change between states some of which occur without time-based reference giving rise to features like wave - particle false duality and the impression of charge among other features. 5.

In this case, the allowed optical transitions are only those for which the azimuthal quantum numbers of the initial and final states differ by unity. The envisaged electric potential of the quantum wire is modeled as inversely parabolic in the radial distance and such that it assumes a value of zero at the surface of the nanostructure. The investigations here are on the influence of this form of the confining potential on the transition rates involving some few electrons’ states of higher radial quantum numbers, nonetheless limited to transitions only between a pair of the electron’s energy sub bands. It is found that a sweep of the strength of the potential gives rise to modulations of the optical transition rates for higher radial quantum numbers. Furthermore, an increase of the strength of this potential reduces the transition energies thus such an increase redshifts peaks of the corresponding transitions rates.",

    "text": "A charged particle, moving at a constant velocity, carries along its electrostatic field Eo . But, as a result of finite speed of light, a particle of charge Q and mass m moving at time t with velocity v and acceleration dv/dt, has a resultant of its electrostatic field in the opposite direction of accelerarion. So, a reactive electric field Ea proportional to and in the opposite direction of the acceleration is created. The field Ea acts only on the same charge Q, producing it, to generate an inertial force f= QEa = -m (dv/dt), where m is a constant equal to the rest mass. For a neutral body of mass M, composed of N/2 positive and N/2 negative charges, the inertial forces on the charges add up to Nf =NQEa = -Nm (dv/dt) = -M (dv/dt). This explains the cause of inertia, the tendency of a body to resist acceleration or deceleration, as the result of self-induced reactive forces on the electric charges composing the body, contrary to general relativity. Expressions are deduced for the mass m and energy E of an electric charge Q, in the form of a spherical shell of radius a, in conformity with a mass-energy equivalence law as E = ½ mc2 , where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, in contrast to special relativity giving E = mc2 . The total energy of a particle of mass m moving at speed v, relative to an observer, is Ev = ½ m (c2 + v2 ).",

The highly nonlinear governing equation, satisfies the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions at both ends of the problem domain.Integral representation of the governing equation over the discretized problem domain is achieved via the Green’s second identity together with the so called free- space Green function . This element-driven approach togetherwith the finite difference approximation of the temporal derivative result in discrete equations which are recursive in nature. At the boundaries of any of the adjacent elements, compatibility conditions and/or boundary conditions are enforced to guarantee scalar continuity. After the resulting system of discrete equations are numerically solved and assembled, they yield the transient history of the scalar variables at any particular point in time. Several numerical tests are carried out to ensure the convergence and accuracy of the formulation by comparing numerical results with those found in literature.",

    "title": "Solution to a Quantum Impurity Model for Moiré Systems: Fermi Liquid, Pairing, and Pseudogap",
    "text": "Recent theoretical and experimental studies have revealed the co-existence of heavy and light electrons in magic-angle multilayer graphene, which form a periodic lattice of Anderson impurities hybridizing with Dirac semi-metals. This work demonstrates that nontrivial features -- pairing potential, pseudogap, and continuous quantum phase transitions -- already appear at the single-impurity level, if valley-anisotropic anti-Hund's interactions ($J_S$, $J_D$) are included, favoring either a singlet ($J_S&gt;J_D$) or a valley doublet ($J_D&gt;J_S$) impurity configuration. We derive a complete phase diagram and analytically solve the impurity problem at several fixed points using bosonization and refermionization techniques. When $J_D&gt;J_S,J_D&gt;0$, the valley doublet only couples via pair-hopping processes to the conduction electrons, in sharp contrast to the conventional Kondo scenario. Upon increasing $J_D$, there is a quantum phase transition of the BKT universality class, from a Fermi liquid to an anisotropic doublet phase, the latter exhibiting power-law susceptibilities with non-universal exponents. On the other hand, when $J_S&gt;J_D,J_S&gt;0$, increasing $J_S$ induces a second-order phase transition from Fermi liquid to a local singlet phase, which involves a non-Fermi liquid as an intermediate fixed point. Near the transition towards the anisotropic doublet (local singlet) phase, the renormalized interaction of the Fermi liquid becomes attractive, favoring doublet (singlet) pairing. Based on analytic solutions, we construct ansatz for the impurity spectral function and correlation self-energy, which account for the pseudogap accompanying side peaks, found in recent spectroscopic measurements and a DMFT study. In particular, we obtain a non-analytic V-shaped spectral function with non-universal exponents in the anisotropic doublet phase. All results are further verified by NRG calculations.",

    "text": "Tunable active metasurfaces have become a major research focus in recent years. Among tuning mechanisms, all-optical coherent control stands out because it requires no material or geometric change, enabling ultrafast, low-energy, interference-based modulation of amplitude, phase, and polarization in ultrathin devices. However, when applied to phase-gradient metasurfaces, coherent control has been limited to small apertures effectively confined to a single Fresnel zone, leading to large divergence and degraded beam quality. Here we propose and numerically validate a scalable method that enables large-area coherent control. The key idea is to use coherent illumination to tune the phase gradient within each Fresnel zone while a direct search algorithm optimizes zone-by-zone parameters to meet system-level targets. Using this principle, we demonstrate continuous tuning of a large-area metasurface for continuous beam-steering without per-meta-atom phase actuation. The same framework applies broadly to continuously tunable phase-gradient optics, including varifocal metalenses, parfocal zoom metalenses, tunable axicons, and related dynamic focusing elements.",

    "text": "Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic degradation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation, starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a play-and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters. Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and improve the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks.

Modulo gauge transformations trivial on the boundary, this yields a moduli space $\\mathcal{M}(\\Gamma)$. We prove that $\\mathcal{M}(\\Gamma)$ is a finite-dimensional smooth symplectic manifold carrying a Hamiltonian action of $G^{\\partial\\Gamma}$ whose moment map records the boundary values of $A_1$. Analytically, we construct slices for the infinite-dimensional gauge action and realize $\\mathcal{M}(\\Gamma)$ by Marsden-Weinstein reduction. For the quiver consisting of a single edge, we recover the classical identification $\\mathcal{M} \\cong T^*G$. In general, we identify $\\mathcal{M}(\\Gamma)$ with a symplectic reduction of $T^*G^E$ by $G^{\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{int}}}$, where $E$ is the set of edges and $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is the set of interior vertices. We further show that $\\mathcal{M}(\\Gamma)$ is invariant under quiver homotopies, implying that it depends only on the surface with boundary obtained by thickening $\\Gamma$.

These show an intriguing dynamics, governed by the strongly nonlinear character of the quantum vortex motion, where we are able to highlight the effects of the boundaries. We first characterize such scattering dynamics via some point-like models, for the cases of an unbounded plane and a confined geometry. Within this framework, we find two fundamental scattering behaviors of a vortex dipole, the \"fly-by\" and the \"go-around\" processes. By plotting the deflection angle of the dipole versus the impact parameter we are able to quantify the transition between different scattering behaviors. We then are able to introduce an analytical distinction of the two scenarios, basing on the point-like model for the plane geometry. Furthermore, another interesting result shows the emergence of an on-average massless dynamics whenever the nonlinear interactions with the obstacle become negligible. Alongside, we investigate the quantum dipole scattering via the numerical simulation of two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations, describing the quantum mixture at a mean-field level. In this way, we benchmark the point-like model against the mean-field simulations.",

    "text": "Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed, such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with 2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation, in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7% mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.",

    "text": "Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism, efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE (Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation. It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified. Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "text": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper, we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.",

    "text": "Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this, self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves 83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.",

The atmosphere of KELT-20 b has been studied extensively via transmission spectroscopy at optical wavelengths, showing strong hydrogen absorption as well as metals including Na I, Ca II, Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Si I and Cr II. The atmospheric and ionization conditions of this planet may differ from Jupiter-mass exoplanets due to the relatively weak extreme-ultraviolet radiation from its host star, as the stellar dynamo that generates chromospheric and coronal activity is thought to shut down at spectral types earlier than A4. We present the first spectroscopic observations of KELT-20 b in the far-ultraviolet using the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, searching for previously undetected low-ionization and neutral atoms in the upper atmosphere. We find that the FUV transit depth increases with decreasing wavelengths, from $1.88\\pm0.04$\\% at 1600--1760 {\\AA} to $2.28\\pm0.04$\\% at 1410--1570 {\\AA}, yielding planetary radii of $0.1139\\pm0.06$ $R_*$ and $0.1222\\pm0.07$ $R_*$, respectively.

    "title": "Think Twice: Branch-and-Rethink Reasoning Reward Model",
    "text": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1 performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise, evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning, BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code and the model will be released soon.",

    "text": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&amp;A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.",

    "text": "We introduce \\textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error, models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric, and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.",

    "title": "Studying the Effluent Quality of Enhanced Modified Ludzack Ettinger-oxic Settling Anaerobic Process (E-MLE-OSA) for Treating Real Municipal Wastewater",
    "text": "Background: Wastewater collection, treatment, discharge, additionally as reusing the treated wastewater in urban are critical factors for maintaining public health preventing contamination of water resources. This study aimed to investigate the performance of enhanced modified Ludzack Ettinger process-oxic settling anaerobic (MLE-OSA) process for treating real municipal wastewater in Sari wastewater Treatment, Sari City, Iran. Methods: To combine the OSA process technique with the MLE system, the Sludge Holding Tanks (SHT) were implemented in the return sludge line of designed pilot studies which comprised 1) MLE, which was regarded as the control system similar; 2) MLE-OSA4 with a 70-L SHT operated at 4-h Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), and 3) MLEOSA6 with a 107-L SHT operated at 6-h HRT. To start the process, the overflow effluent of the primary settling tank of the Sari wastewater treatment plant was used. After 45-60 days, the reactors reached a steady state. The parameters of Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP), temperature, pH, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and nutrients were analyzed. Results: The results revealed that the average TSS, COD, BOD, phosphorus, nitrite, nitrate, and total nitrogen in MLEOSA4 effluent decreased 20.1, 14.6, 2.97, 10, 51.1, 19.3, and 20.7%, respectively compared to MLE. Similarly, in MLE-OSA6, the values decreased 34.2, 16.1, 14.6, 16.7, 69.6, 31.3, and 25.8%, respectively compared to the control process. Conclusion: Therefore, using natural wastewater, the enhanced MLE-OSA process showed better performance in removing the study parameters and better quality for the effluent. Furthermore, the quality of effluent is following the Iran Department of Environment (IDE).",

    "title": "Effect of Drought Stress, Soil Salinity, P. indica, and MWCNs on Biodegradation of Diesel Oil in the Pb- and Cd-Polluted Soil Under Cultivation of Triticale Plant",
    "text": "Background: Today, soil pollution with heavy metals and petroleum compounds is one of the main environmental problems. This research was done to investigate the effect of drought stress, soil salinity, Piriformospora indica (P. indica), and MWCNs on biodegradation of diesel oil in the soil that contaminated with Pb and Cd under cultivation of triticale plant. Methods: Treatments consisted of applying MWCNs (2% [W/W]) in the Pb- and Cd-polluted soil that was simultaneously polluted with diesel oil (0, 5, and 10% [W/W]), and the plants used in this study were inoculated with P. indica. After 70 days, plants were harvested, and plant and soil Cd were measured using AAS (atomic absorption spectrometry). In addition, the degradation percentage of diesel oil in soil was determined. Results: Soil application of MWCNs at the rate of 2% (W/W) significantly increased the biodegradation of diesel oil in the soil in the drought and salinity (6 dS/m) stress by 11.3% and 15.6%, respectively. In addition, plant inoculation with P. indica significantly increased the biodegradation of diesel oil in the soil by 12.3%. For salinity (6 dS/m) and drought stress, it was increased by 8.3% and 9.4%, respectively. In addition, the Pb and Cd concentrations decreased by 14.3% and 12.8%, respectively, when the MWCNs were added to the soil (2% [W/W]). Conclusion: Soil application of MWCNs and plant inoculation with P. indica not only increased the biodegradation of diesel oil but also decreased the plant Pb and Cd concentrations.",

    "text": "Background: Although pregnancy and motherhood are enjoyable experiences, they are associated with numerous biopsychological changes requiring adaptation. The present study aimed to assess the effects of relaxing music on life distress and Maternal-Fetal Attachment (MFA) in pregnant women. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study with a pre-test, post-test and a control group design. The research population included all Iranian pregnant women referring to Laleh Hospital in Tehran City, Iran, in 2020. In total, 30 women were selected using the convenience sampling method and randomly assigned into the intervention and control groups (n=15/group). The required data were collected using the Life Distress Inventory (LDI) and the Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale (MFAS). The intervention group listened to relaxing music for twelve 45-50-minute sessions in the morning and during routine midwifery visits; however, the controls received no intervention. The collected data were analyzed using Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) in SPSS V. 22. Results: The obtained results indicated that the intervention group reported a lower level of life distress in the post-test, compared to the controls (P=0.0001, F=15.860). The intervention group also achieved a higher mean score on MFA, than the control group (P=0.0001, F=35.872). Conclusion: According to the present research findings, reproductive health, nursing professionals, and psychologists could recommend music as a complementary therapy to reduce stress and distress experienced by expecting mothers and to improve MFA.",

    "title": "The Role of Attachment Styles and Spiritual Intelligence in Predicting Women’s Emotional Divorce",
    "text": "Background: Emotional divorce refers to a situation in which the emotional relationship, support, passion, warmth, attention, love, and intimacy between couples (husband &amp; wife) decline or diminish. Such conditions lead to an unaffectionate marital life to the point that the couples are only together under one roof. Accordingly, the present study aimed to explore the role of attachment styles and spiritual intelligence in predicting emotional divorce in women. Methods: This study employed a descriptive-correlational design. The research population included all women filing for divorce who were referred to marriage counseling and couple therapy centers in districts 5 and 6 in Tehran City, Iran, in 2020. In total, 400 women who met the inclusion criteria were selected as the study participants using voluntary response and convenience sampling techniques. The required data were collected by the Emotional Divorce Scale, the Adult Attachment Scale, and the Self-Report Measure of Spiritual Intelligence. The collected data were analyzed using the multiple regression analysis method in SPSS V. 22. Results: The obtained results suggested a significant positive relationship between the anxious-avoidant attachment style and emotional divorce (P&lt;0.01). Furthermore, there was a significant negative relationship between spiritual intelligence and emotional divorce; the higher the spiritual intelligence, the lower the emotional divorce (P=0.02). Accordingly, spiritual intelligence and anxious-avoidant attachment style can predict emotional divorce (Multiple Regressions= -0.58). Conclusion: The present study data suggested that premarital education and counseling before spouse selection help in examining the personality traits of the parties. Moreover, paying attention to the role of health professionals, such as family counselors, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses in providing premarital counseling and education to couples and emphasizing the role of spiritual intelligence and attachment styles may prevent emotional separation and divorce among couples.",

    "text": "We construct Grothendieck topologies on the path category of a finite graph, examining both coarse and discrete cases that offer different perspectives on quiver representations. The coarse topology declares each vertex covered by all incoming morphisms, giving the minimal non-trivial Grothendieck topology where sheaves correspond to dual representations via dualization. The discrete topology is the finest possible, forcing sheaves to be locally constant with isomorphic restriction maps. We verify these satisfy Grothendieck's axioms, characterize their sheaf categories, and establish functorial relationships between them. Sheaves on the coarse site arise naturally from quiver representations through dualization, while discrete sheaves correspond to representations of the groupoid completion. This work suggests intermediate topologies could capture subtler representation-theoretic phenomena.",

Similar dendriform type algebras with three-part and four-part splitting of the associativity were later obtained. These structures can also be derived from actions of suitable linear operators, such as a Rota-Baxter operator or TD operator, on an associative algebra. Motivated by finding a five-part splitting of the associativity, we consider the Rota-Baxter TD (RBTD) operator, an operator combining the Rota-Baxter operator and TD operator, and coming from a recent study of Rota’s problem concerning linear operators on associative algebras. Free RBTD algebras on rooted forests are constructed. We then introduce the concept of a quinquedendriform algebra and show that its defining relations are characterized by the action of an RBTD operator, similar to the cases of dendriform and tridendriform algebras.</jats:p>",

The algebra is a von Neumann algebra of Type II_1. There is a natural notion of entropy for a state of such an algebra. There is a maximum entropy state, which corresponds to empty de Sitter space, and the entropy of any semiclassical state of the Type II_1 algebras agrees, up to an additive constant independent of the state, with the expected generalized entropy S _gen = ( A/ 4 G _ N ) + S _out. An arbitrary additive constant is present because of the renormalization that is involved in defining entropy for a Type II_1 algebra.",

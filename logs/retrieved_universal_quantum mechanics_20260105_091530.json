    "title": "Fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics",
    "text": "<p>The laws of quantum mechanics were formulated in the year 1925 through the work of Werner Heisenberg, followed by Max Born, Pascual Jordan, Paul Dirac, and Wolfgang Pauli. A separate but equivalent approach was independently developed by Erwin Schrödinger in early 1926. The laws governing quantum mechanics were highly mathematical and their aim was to explain many unresolved problems within the framework of a formal theory. The conceptual foundation emerged in the subsequent 2–3 years that indicated how radically different the new laws were from classical physics. In this chapter some of these salient features of quantum mechanics are discussed. The topics include the quantization of energy, wave–particle duality, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, Heisenberg uncertainty relations, Bohr’s principle of complementarity, and quantum superposition and entanglement. This discussion should indicate how different and counterintuitive its fundamentals are from those of classical physics.</p>",

The only specific physical application is the completion of the study of an isolated hydrogen atom, with some discussion of the motion of a particle in a magnetic field. The chapter also outlines the general assumptions of quantum wave mechanics, which may be summarized as follows: the state of a physical system is represented by a wave function and each measurable attribute of the system is represented by a linear self-adjoint operator in the space of functions. To apply these general assumptions to a given physical system, one must give a specific prescription for the observables and their algebra, and one must adopt a definite form for the Hamiltonians as a function of the observables.</p>",

    "text": "<p>In this chapter, three problems whose resolution laid the foundation of quantum mechanics are discussed. First the pioneering work of Max Planck is described who explained the spectrum of light emitted from a so-called blackbody by making a bold ansatz that the energy associated with the oscillations of electrons comes in packets or quanta of energy. Second it is shown how Einstein invoked Planck’s hypothesis to explain the photoelectric effect by arguing that light should come in packets or quanta of energy and this energy should be proportional to the frequency. Electrons are emitted if the energy of the quantum of light, which has come to be known as a photon, is higher than a critical value. The third problem relates to the atomic structure of hydrogen. A full description is given of how Bohr applied a quantization condition to explain the emission of light at certain specific frequencies.</p>",

To find someone's phone number with a probability of 50%, any classical algorithm (whether deterministic or probabilistic) will need to access the database a minimum of $0.5N$ times. Quantum mechanical systems can be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple names. By properly adjusting the phases of various operations, successful computations reinforce each other while others interfere randomly. As a result, the desired phone number can be obtained in only $O(\\sqrt{N})$ accesses to the database.",

    "text": "We show that quaternion quantum mechanics has well-founded mathematical roots and can be derived from the model of the elastic continuum by French mathematician Augustin Cauchy, i.e., it can be regarded as representing the physical reality of elastic continuum. Starting from the Cauchy theory (classical balance equations for isotropic Cauchy-elastic material) and using the Hamilton quaternion algebra, we present a rigorous derivation of the quaternion form of the non- and relativistic wave equations. The family of the wave equations and the Poisson equation are a straightforward consequence of the quaternion representation of the Cauchy model of the elastic continuum. This is the most general kind of quantum mechanics possessing the same kind of calculus of assertions as conventional quantum mechanics. The problem of the Schrödinger equation, where imaginary ‘i’ should emerge, is solved. This interpretation is a serious attempt to describe the ontology of quantum mechanics, and demonstrates that, besides Bohmian mechanics, the complete ontological interpretations of quantum theory exists. The model can be generalized and falsified. To ensure this theory to be true, we specified problems, allowing exposing its falsity.",

    "title": "Quantum mechanics–free subsystem with mechanical oscillators",
    "text": "Quantum entanglement goes large Quantum entanglement occurs when two separate entities become strongly linked in a way that cannot be explained by classical physics; it is a powerful resource in quantum communication protocols and advanced technologies that aim to exploit the enhanced capabilities of quantum systems. To date, entanglement has generally been limited to microscopic quantum units such as pairs or multiples of single ions, atoms, photons, and so on. Kotler et al. and Mercier de Lépinay et al. demonstrate the ability to extend quantum entanglement to massive macroscopic systems (see the Perspective by Lau and Clerk). Entanglement of two mechanical oscillators on such a large length and mass scale is expected to find widespread use in both applications and fundamental physics to probe the boundary between the classical and quantum worlds. Science, this issue p. 622, p. 625; see also p. 570 Quantum entanglement is demonstrated in macroscopic mechanical oscillators. Quantum mechanics sets a limit for the precision of continuous measurement of the position of an oscillator. We show how it is possible to measure an oscillator without quantum back-action of the measurement by constructing one effective oscillator from two physical oscillators. We realize such a quantum mechanics–free subsystem using two micromechanical oscillators, and show the measurements of two collective quadratures while evading the quantum back-action by 8 decibels on both of them, obtaining a total noise within a factor of 2 of the full quantum limit. This facilitates the detection of weak forces and the generation and measurement of nonclassical motional states of the oscillators. Moreover, we directly verify the quantum entanglement of the two oscillators by measuring the Duan quantity 1.4 decibels below the separability bound.",

    "title": "Quantum Mechanics in the Light of Quantum Cosmology",
    "text": "We sketch a quantum mechanical framework for the universe as a whole. Within that framework we propose a program for describing the ultimate origin in quantum cosmology of the quasiclassical domain of familiar experience and for characterizing the process of measurement. Predictions in quantum mechanics are made from probabilities for sets of alternative histories. Probabilities can be assigned only to sets of histories that approximately decohere. Decoherence is defined and the mechanism of decoherence is reviewed. Decoherence requires a sufficiently coarse-grained description of alternative histories of the universe. A quasiclassical domain consists of a branching set of alternative decohering histories, described by a coarse graining that is maximally refined consistent with decoherence, with individual branches that exhibit a high level of classical correlation in time. A quasiclassical domain is emergent in the universe as a consequence of the initial condition and the action function of the elementary particles. It is an important question whether all the quasiclassical domains are roughly equivalent or whether there are various essentially inequivalent ones. A measurement is a correlation with variables in a quasiclassical domain. An observer (or information gathering and utilizing system) is a complex adaptive system that has evolved to exploit the relative predictability of a quasiclassical domain. We suggest that resolution of many of the problems of interpretation presented by quantum mechanics is to be accomplished, not by further scrutiny of the subject as it applies to reproducible laboratory situations, but rather by an examination of alternative histories of the universe, stemming from its initial condition, and a study of the problem of quasiclassical domains.",

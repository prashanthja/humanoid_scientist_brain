    "text": "<jats:p>Classical physics is based on the mathematical analysis of differential equation models of physical systems. Yet, because differential equations are an advanced topic, they are typically not taught until the second or third year at the university. This paper describes a new approach to teaching calculus that covers differential equations in the tenth week.</jats:p>",

    "title": "The calculus of consent : logical foundations of constitutional democracy",
    "text": "THE CALCULUS OF CONSENT was co-authored by Buchanan with Gordon Tullock, with whom Buchanan collaborated on many books and academic enterprises throughout their careers. As Robert D Tollison states in the foreword: (this book) is a radical departure from the way democracies conduct their business. The 'Calculus' is already a book for the ages. This classic work analyses the political organisation of a free society through the lens of the economic organisation of society. The authors acknowledge their unease as economists in analysing the political organisation, but they take the risk of forging into unfamiliar territory because they believe the benefits of their perspective will bear much fruit. As the authors state, their objective in this book is \"to analyze the calculus of the rational individual when he is faced with questions of constitutional choice...We examine the (choice) process extensively only with reference to the problem of decision-making rules.\" The authors describe their approach as 'economic individualism'. They believe that economists have explored individual choice extensively in the market sector while social scientists have largely ignored the dynamics of individual decision-making in the dynamics of forming group action in the public sector. Written in the early 1960s, THE CALCULUS OF CONSENT has become a bulwark of the public choice movement for which James M Buchanan is so justly famous.",

    "title": "Calculus on Manifolds",
    "text": "Description: The three higher-dimensional versions of the fundamental theorem of calculus – Green's theorem, the divergence theorem, and Stokes' theorem – that one encounters in a typical multi-variable calculus course have two paradoxical characteristics. On the one hand, these results lie at the center of many areas of mathematics and the physical sciences, including analysis of partial differential equations, fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics. On the other hand, most students don't understand these theorems and almost certainly forget them after the final exam (I do not except myself from this category). The purpose of this course is essentially a semester-long study of the modern version of Stokes' theorem and the mathematics needed to build it up (Green's theorem and the divergence theorem are corollaries of Stokes). In fact, the mathematics we develop along the way will include topics that appear at the foundation of modern differential geometry and algebraic topology. The first part of the course will focus on calculus in higher dimensions: differentiation and integration of functions defined on R n , along with a basic study of topology in R n. We will see, for example, the implicit and inverse function theorems, Fubini's theorem, and the change-of-variables formula for integration. The second part of the course will introduce important algebraic objects that are used in geometry (e.g., tensors, differential forms, and singular chains), along with operations between them (e.g., products, exterior differentiation, and boundary chains). This will be done in the setting of R n , and we will see a version of Stokes' theorem here. The third part of the course will move to the setting of manifolds. A manifold is, colloquially, a space that, on small patches, \" looks like R n \" (e.g., a sphere, or the surface of a donut, or the entire donut when we allow for manifolds-with-boundary). Formally, it is helpful to keep the following in mind: calculus can be done in R n , calculus involves local analysis of functions, manifolds look like R n locally.. .therefore, calculus can be done on manifolds! We will make this rigorous by transferring our work from the second part of the course to the manifold setting. In the end, we will prove the following general version of Stokes' theorem and understand what it actually means! M dω = ∂M ω Textbook: We will follow Michael Spivak's book \" Calculus on Manifolds \" very closely. …",

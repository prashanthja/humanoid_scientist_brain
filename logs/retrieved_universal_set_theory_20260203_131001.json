    "text": "<p>The dynamic abstractionist approach to set theory canvassed in Chapter 3 is properly developed. We begin with a plural version of Frege’s Basic Law V. While this law is inconsistent in the ordinary static setting, it becomes consistent when transposed to a dynamic setting. Thus transposed, the law ensures that any objects whatsoever can be used to define a set. This is an intuitive and highly explanatory principle of set formation, which traces its roots back to Cantor. The resulting dynamic approach to set theory justifies all of ordinary ZF set theory and provides an explication of the celebrated iterative conception of sets.</p>",

    "text": "QCA is a set-theoretic method. But what are sets and how does a set-theoretic approach differ from other approaches? At the most basic level, a set can be defined as a group of elements that share certain characteristics. For George Lakoff and Rafael Núñez, one way to see sets is as a “containerlike entity” (Lakoff and Núñez 2000, 140) and James Mahoney describes sets as “boundaries that define zones of inclusion and exclusion” (Mahoney 2010, 7). Given these understandings, it is apparent that sets and concepts are closely interlinked. In fact, most social science theories are grounded in set theory, either explicitly by using the language of necessary and sufficient conditions, or implicitly by invoking the set-theoretic logic without expressly referring to necessity and sufficiency (Goertz and Mahoney 2012; Schneider and Wagemann 2012).2",

    "title": "A systematic literature review of soft set theory",
    "text": "Soft set theory, initially introduced through the seminal article “Soft set theory—First results” in 1999, has gained considerable attention in the field of mathematical modeling and decision-making. Despite its growing prominence, a comprehensive survey of soft set theory, encompassing its foundational concepts, developments, and applications, is notably absent in the existing literature. We aim to bridge this gap. This survey delves into the basic elements of the theory, including the notion of a soft set, the operations on soft sets, and their semantic interpretations. It describes various generalizations and modifications of soft set theory, such as N-soft sets, fuzzy soft sets, and bipolar soft sets, highlighting their specific characteristics. Furthermore, this work outlines the fundamentals of various extensions of mathematical structures from the perspective of soft set theory. Particularly, we present basic results of soft topology and other algebraic structures such as soft algebras and σ\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$\\sigma$$\\end{document}-algebras. This article examines a selection of notable applications of soft set theory in different fields, including medicine and economics, underscoring its versatile nature. The survey concludes with a discussion on the challenges and future directions in soft set theory, emphasizing the need for further research to enhance its theoretical foundations and broaden its practical applications. Overall, this survey of soft set theory serves as a valuable resource for practitioners, researchers, and students interested in understanding and utilizing this flexible mathematical framework for tackling uncertainty in decision-making processes.",

    "text": ". The construction of ﬁrst-order logic and set theory gives rise to apparent circularities of mutual dependence, making it unclear which can act as a self-contained starting point in the foundation of mathematics. In this paper, we carry out a metathe-oretic and ﬁnitistic development of a ﬁrst-order logical system in which we deﬁne formal set theory (ZFC). We contend that the techniques employed in constructing this system oﬀer a philosophically sound basis for introducing ZFC and proceeding with the conventional formal development of mathematics. Lastly, by examining the chronology of the aforementioned construction, we attempt to answer the titular question.",

    "title": "Career selection of students using hybridized distance measure based on picture fuzzy set and rough set theory",
    "text": "Since the future of the society depends upon the role of students and their services construct the prosperous and advanced society, so suitable career selection for the students' is considered to be an important problem to explore. As per psychology, if a student has the required capability, and positive attitudes towards a subject in terms of interest, attitude, memory, knowledge, environment, and career, then the student will achieve more in that subject. To consider this kind of uncertain issues, picture fuzzy set and rough set are found to be appropriate due to their inherent characteristics to deal with incomplete and imprecise information. In this study, picture fuzzy set and rough set-based approaches are proposed to help the student to choose an appropriate subject and consequently provide a good service or contribution to the society particularly in that domain. The main purpose of the article is to analyse student's features in terms of career, memory, interest, knowledge, environment and attitude and then predict the appropriate stream for making the career comfortable so that the student can conveniently explore much in that area. To select students' career, a hybridized distance measure under picture fuzzy environment is proposed where the evaluating information regarding students, subjects and student's features are given in picture fuzzy numbers. In this paper, two types of hybridization approaches are proposed which are the hybridization of Hausdorff and Hamming distance measures and hybridization of Hausdorff and Euclidean distance measures. Next, we apply rough set theory to determine whether a particular subject is appropriate for a student even if there is controversy to select a stream. Lower and higher approximation with boundary region of rough set theory is used to manage inconsistency situations. Finally, two case studies are demonstrated to validate the applicability of the proposed idea.",

    "title": "How Firm Are the Foundations of Mind-Set Theory? The Claims Appear Stronger Than the Evidence",
    "text": "Mind-set refers to people’s beliefs about whether attributes are malleable (growth mind-set) or unchangeable ( fixed mind-set). Proponents of mind-set theory have made bold claims about mind-set’s importance. For example, one’s mind-set is described as having profound effects on one’s motivation and achievements, creating different psychological worlds for people, and forming the core of people’s meaning systems. We examined the evidentiary strength of six key premises of mind-set theory in 438 participants; we reasoned that strongly worded claims should be supported by equally strong evidence. However, no support was found for most premises. All associations (rs) were significantly weaker than .20. Other achievement-motivation constructs, such as self-efficacy and need for achievement, have been found to correlate much more strongly with presumed associates of mind-set. The strongest association with mind-set (r = −.12) was opposite from the predicted direction. The results suggest that the foundations of mind-set theory are not firm and that bold claims about mind-set appear to be overstated.",

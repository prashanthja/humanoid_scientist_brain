    "text": "<p>‘Relativistic astrophysics’ outlines the relativity theory and lists some situations where this theory is needed: radio galaxies, micro-quasars, gamma rays, cosmic rays, neutron stars, x-ray sources, the solar system, and the universe. It goes on to explain muon lifetimes, rest-mass energy, plasma jets, shocks and particle acceleration, and synchrotron radiation. Einstein’s theory of general relativity is dependent on non-linear equations and the only exact solutions of Einstein’s equations that we have are ones with special symmetries. The phenomena of gravitational redshift, gravitational lensing, gravitational microlensing, deflection of light by the Sun, Shapiro delays, and pulsars and gravitational waves are then discussed.</p>",

    "text": "Astrophysics is a science that applies the methods and principles of physics and chemistry in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena including the universe. As one of the founders of the discipline, James Keeler, said, astrophysics \"seeks to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in space—what they are, rather than where they are\", which is studied in celestial mechanics.",
